description: Set up the development environment for Medplum
---

Please help me set up the local development environment for this Medplum project:

1. Check if Docker is running
2. Start docker-compose services (PostgreSQL + Redis)
3. Install all dependencies with `npm install`
4. Run database migrations
5. Provide instructions for starting the server and app in dev mode

Report any issues encountered and provide next steps.
